    <h3>Working out</h2>
        <h3>Over COVID-19 I discovered working out. It helped passed the time and made me feel a lot better. My favorite
            workouts include weight lifting, barre, and pilates. I recently just started trying to run for cardio, to
            gain endurance to go on runs with my dog. Walking is also one of my favorite workouts if you don't feel like
            doing too much. Walking on the treadmill at a speed of 3, incline of 12 for 30 minutes is a great way to
            burn fat.</h3>
