                <p> Welcome to my Health Website for Women</p>
                <p>Taking CSIT 121 this semester was extremely challenging because I had never taken a coding class, and
                    I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect before taking this class. I had a few challenges during this final
                    project. When I first started, I thought I could link the websites so it would appear in the middle
                    of the page, but I soon realized that would be very difficult.I also had trouble with the formatting
                    and styling the website. Otherwise, I am very happy about how my website turned out.
                    my project turned out. </p>
                <p>Something I learned from taking this CSIT class and during this final project is that you need to be
                    patient. I often felt frustrated and defeated during the weekly assignments and final. I quickly
                    learned in the beginning of the semester that practicing is important, and that HTML and CSS can be
                    a trial-and-error process. Overall, I taking this class taught me something completely new and it
                    really challenged me. </p>
